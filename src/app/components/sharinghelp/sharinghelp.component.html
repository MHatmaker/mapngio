                Multiple users can view synchronized maps in web browsers on other devices.
                After  finding
                <br>
                (1) a Google Map or Leaflet Map or
                <br>
                (2) an ArcGIS WebMap
                <br>
                that you want to share:

                After selecting a map exent and zoom level (and optionally performing a spatial query
                using the Google search too), perform two steps:

            <ul>Steps For Publishing
                <li>
                     1. If you haven't subscribed to a Pusher channel or entered a user/collaborator name,
                      open the "Set Pusher Channel" menu, and follow the instructions to enter these details.
                </li>
                <li>
                    2. Open the "Publish Current Url" menu and click the "Publish Url" button.
                    This will open a new window with the current zoom, extent, and search results on the
                    publisher's system, and will open the same new window on all collaborators' systems.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <br>
            <ul>Steps for Sharing
                <li>
                     1. Open the "Copy MapLinkr Url" menu. The url for the current host site will be inserted
                     in the text field and will be focused and selected.
                </li>
                <li>
                     2. Use Ctrl-C to copy it to the clipboard.
                </li>
                <li>
                     3. Paste the link in a text message or email to collaborators or in a shared chat window.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                The url includes the name of the Pusher channel that you have selected.
                As users open  the link, they will be subscribing to share map clicks, pans and zooms
                with all other users as any user manipulates any map view.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Pusher channel can also be set without opening a new map viewer by opening the
                "Set  Pusher Channel" menu option.  Share this channel name with collaborators to
                synchronize their displays with your display.  This step is necessary if you and
                your collaborators want to synchronize map views where all collaborators already
                have synchronize-capable maps open.
            </p>
            <p>
                At any time a user has opened a new ArcGIS map and desires to share the map with
                collaborators, the "Publish Current Url" menu provides the necessary tool.  The
                user opens the menu option in the window containing the map to be shared and clicks
                the "Publish Url" button.
            </p>
